# Webleaf
A Nanoleaf Aurora WebApp

It's neither very stable nor very secure at the moment, but it kinda works :-)

## Features

* Control one or multiple Auroras
* Change effect, brightness and white balance
* Support for multiple users with different Auroras

## Guide

1. python manage.py db upgrade

This should create the DB.

To start the app: python manage.py runserver

You should be able to access Webleaf on localhost:5000.
